# ExpensesTracker

ExpensesTracker is the app made for tracking expenses of users. 

User can change the currency that expenses are going to be saved in.

All data is stored on devices locally and nobody can access it remotely, unless you want to store it on server.

All data can be backed up on Firebase server but only if user clicks the button to do that.

Data can also be auto backed up if user checks Auto backup option in settings.

All data can be deleted from device and server if user wants by clicking one button in app settings.
